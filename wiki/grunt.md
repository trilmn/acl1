# Setup Grunt Task Runner

1. If you haven't installed Grunt before, do so with by running this command in your Terminal `npm install -g grunt-cli`. If `npm` isn't install you can go [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/installing-node) for the steps on how to install it.
2. Now make sure you're at the project's root directory.
3. Install project dependencies with `npm install`, this would now install all dependencies listed in `package.json`.
4. Once that completed, run Grunt with `grunt`.
