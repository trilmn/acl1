  <strong>Notice:</strong>
  <p>Well should be used when you want the content to stand out of the crowd. Please never use two wells at the same time and in the same place. Wells can have different appearances by adding the following classes: <code>.-info</code> <code>.-success</code> <code>.-warning</code> <code>.-danger</code>. Sizes of wells could be varied based on the size of its containing element. It is recommended to determine the size of a well by using <code>.cols-*</code> layout classes.</p>

<h5 class="section-title">Usage</h5>

  <strong>Notice:</strong>
  <ul>
    <li>As mentioned above, a well can hold many things. But don't put an entire webpage or a large component inside it because, at the end of the day, a well is originally used to add contrast into an important piece of information.</li>
    <li>Styling the content inside a well is relatively easy. Since all wells are <code>display: flex;</code> by default, all the elements inside could easily be arranged using that method. See more <a href="http://www.sketchingwithcss.com/samplechapter/cheatsheet.html">here</a>.</li>
